            Hello. My name is Ethan. I am a coder who has been programming and making games and rendering engines since 2015.<br>
            I specialise mostly in the Lua/Luau scripting language, but I can also code in Python, HTML and a tiny bit of C#.
            
            Most of my skills have been done via the Roblox engine. I like to makes games and also custom game/renderer engines within roblox.

            <p>The game takes place in a small part of a town called 'Myrtle Grove', which you find that the usual exit through a tunnel has been collapsed, meaning you and your crew must find a new way to escape.<br> 
                Along your journey, you'll quickly find an old abandoned car stored away, which can fit up to 4 people.</p><br>
            <p>A perfect utility and getaway vehicle which you must get going and then maintain in order to make it out alive as quickly as possible</p>

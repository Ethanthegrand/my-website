            <b>Kill The Evil Bosses</b> is my first game on this account and my first semi-successful game too. 
            Released late in 2016, this game aimed to be a battle game, with 1 primary game mode, and 2 secondary game modes: "Boss Battle", "Zombie Survival" and "Free For All".<br>
            <br>

            <p align="center"><img src="../../images/games/killtheevilbosses3.png" onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');" alt="A creation with fire and explosions" width="600px" height="600px"><br>

            The <b>Boss Battle</b> gamemode featured a variety of bosses all their own attacks and difficult rating.<br>
           
            <br>
            The <b>Zombie Survival</b> gamemode featured a game where the goal was to survive until the timer ends. 
            This mode featured many types of zombies with different stats and weapons.
            
            <br>
            
            When the round starts, everyone is assigned as a survivor and must survive NPC and player zombies
            When a survivor dies, they become a zombie with all their gears replaced with a zombie tool.

            <br><br>
            The <b>Free For All</b> gamemode has all players be forced into the arena and to fight everyone to the death until one player remains or the timer runs out.<br>
            <br>

            Beating ones of these gamemodes will have the game enter an intermission state. The large door in the arena will then open, 
            leading to a simple obby which has a money chest at the end.

            Around 2017-2018, the game would see a good amount of concurrent players. The game would typically reach Around 10-40 players at once during this time.

            <br>

            The game received it's last official content update in 2020. The game is now discontinued and only receives occasional bug fixes.

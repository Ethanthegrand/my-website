            <b>Before 3 AM</b> is a two part game where the player must observe, survive and escape a mythical monster known as Shadow Man.<br>
            <br>
            The game takes place at an old and low budget weapons factory built in the 50s. The player is a security officer whose job is to 
            protect the building from trespassers, but little does the player know that this monster is more than just a murderer.<br>
            
            
            <br>
            This game was my first successful and popular game peaking at about <b>1,900</b> concurrent players in 2020.</b>.<br>
            <br>

            This sudden burst of popularity was gained mostly from Roblox youtuber, Flamingo. This was the video that gave the game its popularity:
            <br>

            The game eventually died out in late 2020 due to the lack of replayability. Updates for the game was officially discontinued sometime in 2021.
            The game will still be maintained but only for bug fixes.
